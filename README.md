# DE\_PROJECTS

A beginner-friendly collection of my data engineering projects.
Iâ€™m currently focusing on improving my SQL skills and exploring new frameworks used in data engineering.

Each folder in this repository is its own standalone project, tackling a real-world problem from start to finish.

## Whatâ€™s inside

* End-to-end ETL pipelines
* SQL practice and optimization
* Experiments with DE tools and frameworks
* Real-world inspired problem solving
